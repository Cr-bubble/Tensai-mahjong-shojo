# Tensai-mahjong-shojo - ML 2024 Final Project

A project focused on training an AI capable of playing Japanese Mahjong effectively and competing against real players in online Mahjong games.

We chose Mahjong Soul (雀魂麻將) as the platform for testing and gameplay.

## Project Structure

- **web/**  
  Contains all the necessary components for our agent to communicate with Mahjong Soul.

- **model/**  
  Includes three models we trained and developed for this project.

- **tool/**  
  Provides helper tools utilized during the development and training process.
  
- **run.ipynb**  
  The final executable Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the complete workflow and results of our project.
  

## Highlights

This project demonstrates a hybrid approach that combines reinforcement learning (RL) and neural networks (NN) to train a Mahjong-playing AI, integrating gameplay strategies and real-time interactions with an online platform.
